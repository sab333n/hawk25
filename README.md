NoScroll AI

We all scroll, be it doom or normally. But Have you ever wondered:

How is this affecting my mental state?

Is the algorithm shaping my mood, or am I shaping it?

NoScroll AI is an AI-powered feedback tool that helps you understand, manage, and take back control of your digital consumption.


### Key Features

**Content and Sentiment Tracking**
Detects the type and emotional tone of the content you consume (e.g. news, entertainment, social media).

**Smart Feedback and Nudges**
Warns you when you begin falling into low-value or negative scrolling patterns.

**Negativity Threshold Lockout**
If your consumption crosses a certain threshold of negativity, NoScroll will lock itself and/or block certain sites for the day, giving you time to reset.

**Insight Reports**
Daily and weekly summaries show what you’ve been consuming, how it may be affecting you, and what patterns are forming over time.

**Mindfulness Suggestions**
When intervention is needed, NoScroll offers helpful alternatives like journaling, calming music, or stepping away.

**Mission**
NoScroll AI is not about limiting you—it's about making your screen time intentional.
By providing feedback, setting boundaries, and promoting awareness, it helps you stop unconscious scrolling and reclaim your focus.
